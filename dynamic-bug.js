This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js, and you have a component that dynamically generates content which changes the class names. The problem arises when Tailwind's purge process removes unused CSS classes, accidentally eliminating classes that were generated dynamically. This leads to missing styles in the dynamically generated content.
